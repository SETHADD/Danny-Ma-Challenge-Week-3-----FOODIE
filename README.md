# Danny-Ma-Challenge-Week-3-----FOODIE
Subscription based businesses are super popular and Danny realised that there was a large gap in the market - he wanted to create a new streaming service that only had food related content - something like Netflix but with only cooking shows! This is repository to help Danny answer some questions using SQL Queries on their data  
# Introduction
Danny Ma Provided several data sets to help practice SQl and I partook in the Challenge.This is the 3rd week challenge that helps Danny's food version of netflix.


**DISCLAIMER;**  this is not a real data
## Problem Statement

Danny finds a few smart friends to launch his new startup Foodie-Fi in 2020 and started selling monthly and annual subscriptions, giving their customers unlimited on-demand access to exclusive food videos from around the world!

Danny created Foodie-Fi with a data driven mindset and wanted to ensure all future investment decisions and new features were decided using data. This case study focuses on using subscription style digital data to answer important business questions.

## Skills Demonstrated

1. Create the Subscriptions and plan tables  and create relatiomship between the tables

PLAN TABLE | SUBSCRIPTIONS TABLE
------------|---------------

## Analysis
I was able to help Danny's Foodie answer some important questions, such as:

* How many customers has Foodie-Fi ever had?
* What is the monthly distribution of trial plan start_date values for our dataset - use the start of the month as the group by value
* What plan start_date values occur after the year 2020 for our dataset? Show the breakdown by count of events for each plan_name
* What is the customer count and percentage of customers who have churned rounded to 1 decimal place?
* How many customers have churned straight after their initial free trial - what percentage is this rounded to the nearest whole number?
* What is the number and percentage of customer plans after their initial free trial?
* What is the customer count and percentage breakdown of all 5 plan_name values at 2020-12-31?
* How many customers have upgraded to an annual plan in 2020?
* How many days on average does it take for a customer to an annual plan from the day they join Foodie-Fi?
* Can you further breakdown this average value into 30 day periods (i.e. 0-30 days, 31-60 days etc)
* How many customers downgraded from a pro monthly to a basic monthly plan in 2020

These are the snippets from the queries

## Conclusion

The important lesson from this project was that understanding the data gives a better approach to getting great insights.
